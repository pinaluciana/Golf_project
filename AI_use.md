# Use of external tools and AI

In order to develop this project’s code and write the report, some external tools were used. However, these tools were merely used for support and editing and were not used to generate content.

## Code development
**Tools used:** YouTube tutorials, library documentation, Claude and ChatGPT

**Used for:** debugging in general, understanding error messages, explaining Python library documentation (for statsmodels, SHAP and xgboost), resolving library compatibility issues, understanding pandas operations, 
finding out the best practices for scikit-learn and GridSearchCV, formatting of the visualizations in matplotlib and seaborn, and understanding SHAP value computation and TreeExplainer output classification.

All logic, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model design, evaluation and code structure were developed independently.

## Report writing
**Tools used:** Grammarly and ChatGPT.

**Used for:** rephrasing to improve clarity and readability, checking grammar and consistency, and formatting in LaTeX.

The research question, methodology, analysis, result interpretation and conclusions are original work. The external tools were only used to polish the report, not to generate any content or interpretations.
